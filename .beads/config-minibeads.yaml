# Minibeads-specific configuration options
# This file contains options that are NOT compatible with upstream bd

# Use hash-based issue IDs instead of sequential numbers
# When true, issues are named like: prefix-a1b2c3 (based on content hash)
# When false, issues are named like: prefix-1, prefix-2, ... (sequential)
# Default: false
mb-hash-ids: false

# Hash encoding format for hash-based IDs
# base36: Uses characters [0-9a-z] for better information density (recommended, matches upstream bd)
# hex: Uses characters [0-9a-f] for hexadecimal encoding (legacy format)
# Default: base36
hash-encoding: base36
