# Description

Example: Machine page. Is this even in the local time zone? In addition to '11/30/2025, 11:42:49 AM' it would be great to print how long ago that was: '11/30/2025, 11:42:49 AM; 10 min, 38 seconds ago.' Use the same printing logic already in the codebase for human readable time deltas. Don't duplicate code\!
