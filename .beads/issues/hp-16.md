# Description

Add a way to enter/save commands on the machine/<hash-id>/ page. New section 'Stored Shell Commands', similar to previously used paths. Each command has a 'Play' button. Pressing play launches the command in a subprocess of the happy daemon on that machine (show PID). Runs async, allows navigating away. REQUIRES INTERACTIVE PLANNING - don't implement until plan is approved.
