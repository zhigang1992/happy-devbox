# Description

Currently ElevenLabs config is set via env vars on the server, which assumes single-account usage. Need to move to per-account configuration:

1. Show ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID and ELEVENLABS_API_KEY in Voice Assistant settings section
2. Allow users to change these values, persisted to their account
3. Add toggle: use hardcoded production agent vs custom agent
4. If production agent toggled off, user must enter their own agent ID and API key
5. Different accounts should be able to use different agents

This follows the pattern of other connection settings like server URL and GitHub account linking.
