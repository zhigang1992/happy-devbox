Coding conventions
========================================

PREFER STRONG TYPES. For example, in Rust do not use "u32" or "String" where you can have a more specific type or at least a type alias. "String" makes it very unclear which values are legal. We want explicit Enums to lock down the possibilities for our state, and we want separate types for numerical IDs and distinct, non-overlapping uses of basic integers.

Delete trailing spaces. Don't leave empty lines that consist only of whitespace. (Double newline is fine.)

Add README.md files for every major subdirectory/subsystem.  For example `src/system1/`, `src/system2/`, etc.

Read the PROJECT_VISION, if this is a high-performance project, e.g. in Rust, we should follow for high-performance Rust (unboxing, minimizing allocation, etc). In particular, adhere to the below programming patterns / avoid anti-patterns, which generally fall under the principle of "zero copy":

- Avoid clone: instead take a temporary reference to the object and manage lifetimes appropriately.
- Avoid collect: instead take an iterator with references to the original collection without copying.

Workflow: Tasks and Commits
========================================

Commit to git with each unit of work.

Task Tracking
----------------------------------------

We use "beads" to track our issues locally under version control. Review `bd quickstart` to learn how to use it. 

Every time we do a git commit, update our beads issues to reflect:
- What was just completed (check off items in lists, close completed task(s))
- What's next (update the in tracking issues that track the granular issues)
- Mention in the commit any new issues created to document bugs found or future work.

The beads database is our primary tracking mechanism, so if we lose conversation history we can start again from there.  You should periodically do documentation work, usually before committing, to make sure information in the issues is up-to-date.

### Beads CONVENTIONS for this project

Do NOT read or modify files inside the `./.beads/` private database, except when fixing merge conflicts in markdown files that you can read.

Prefer the MCP client to the CLI tool. ALWAYS `bd update` existing issues, never introduce duplicates with spurious `bd create`.

The issue prefix may be customized (`foobar-1`, `foobar-2`), but here we will refer `bd-1` as example issue names

#### Tracking issues and Priorities

- Issues labeled "human" are created by me and will always have 0 priority.
- Issue bd-1, at priority 0, is the OVERALL tracking issue. It primarily references other tracking issues
  and reiterate some of these conventions. We want to keep it pretty short.

- The next tracking issues, e.g. bd-2 and on have priority 1 and are topic-specific trackers:
  - Optimization tracking
  - Feature completeness
  - Cross-cutting codebase issues (refactorings, change of dependencies/conventions, etc)
 - All tracking issues refer to granular issues by name in their text, e.g. "bd-42"
 - All other granular issues will have priority 3 to 4 unless they are seen as a critical bug, which will bump them to priority 2.

#### Mark transient information

We often record transient information, like benchmark results, that quickly gets out of date. We want to label such information so we can tell how old it is. In addition to YYYY-MM-DD, our convention is to use:
  `git rev-list --count HEAD`
which prints out the number of commits in the repo (or equivalently the ./gitdepth.sh script), and then format the timestamp as `YYYY-MM-DD_#DEPTH(387498cecf)` e.g. `2025-10-22_#161(387498cecf)`. That's our full timestamp
for any transient information that derives from a specific commit.
Sometimes this requires us to split our commits into (1) functionality and then (2) documentation-update.

#### Reference issues in code TODO

We don't want TODO items to be in floating code alone. For anything but the most trivial TODOs, we adopt the convention of referencing issues that tracks the TODO:

```
// TODO(bd-13): brief summary here
```

Then, the commit that fixes the issue both removes the comment and closes the issue in beads.

#### Use description field only, not notes

When creating or updating issues with `bd`, always put ALL content in the description field. Do NOT use the --notes field, as it creates duplication and confusion between what's in description vs notes. Keep information consolidated in the description field only, but you may use labels for classification.

Clean Start: Before beginning work on a task
--------------------------------------------

Make sure we start in a clean state. Check that we have no uncommitted changes in our working copy. Perform `git pull origin main` to make sure we are starting with the latest version. Check that `make validate` passes in our starting state.

If github MCP is configured and github actions workflows exist for this project, check the github actions CI status for the most recent commit and make sure it not red (if it's still pending, ignore and proceed). If
there's a CI failure, then fixing THAT becomes our task. Finally, check that `make validate` passes locally in our starting state.

Pre-Commit: checks before committing to git
--------------------------------------------

Run `make validate` and ensure that it passes or fix any problems before committing.

Also include a `Test Results Summary` section in every commit message that summarizes how many tests passed of what kind.

If you validate some changes with a new manual or temporary test, that test should be added to either the unit tests, examples, or e2e tests and it should be called consistently from both `make validate` and Github CI.
